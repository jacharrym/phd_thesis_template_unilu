abstract = {Using the diffusion quantum Monte Carlo method, the binding energy of positronium hydroxide (alternatively, the positronium affinity of the hydroxyl radical) has been calculated at a new level of accuracy and found to be 0.63±0.15 eV. Using the same methods, we also calculate the electron affinity of the hydroxyl radical to be 1.86±0.14 eV, which is in agreement with the experimental value. To the authors' knowledge, this is the only calculation of these quantities for which this essential consistency is demonstrated. {\textcopyright}1996 The American Physical Society.},
